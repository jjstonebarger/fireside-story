    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The streets were quiet for once. People avoided them on nights like these...</p>
    <p>As of late a spree of murders were reported amongst the dark foggy alleys...</p>
    <p>It was the perfect cover for Chuck Norris. Where was he? Pakistan. His Mission? Assassinate Osama Bin Laden
      and save the world from terrorism forever. </p>
    <p>In defense of our 'Merican freedoms Chuck Norris threw a grenade. It killed 50 of Bin Laden's guards....then it exploded</p>
